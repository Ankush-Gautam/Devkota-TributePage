            Champa (Nepali: चम्पा) is the only novel written by Laxmi Prasad
            Devkota. The book was written around the year 1947–48 and published
            posthumously 20 years later. The novel is unique among Devkota's
            works as the only one depicting contemporary social issues and roles
            of women in society. Set in Kathmandu during the Rana rule, it
            depicts a society firmly adhering to traditional gender roles, with
            men engaged in learning and travelling, and women, uneducated and
            limited to household chores and religious activities.
